# CoHome
 The coronavirus pandemic has changed our way of life, and since we can only adapt to such a life. Scientists have proven that working in a cafe increases productivity, but due to social distancing, we can no longer get together in public places. Co-working has become inaccessible in our usual sense. Our application could be solution of this problem. Our project is web application that allows people of one job sphere communicate and work distantly without leaving their home. That is sort of Online Co-working. Application users can go to conferences with strangers who are working or studying in the same direction as you, which allows them to discuss your work, thereby increasing motivation.
 This project is unique for Kazakhstan.
 Main auditory of the project are people who accidently were sent to working or studying from home or just have no opportunity to unite in real life. For example, this could be some entrepreneurs, small company, or software engineers. In general, this application could help every person who needs to work or study from home, communicate with others, and manage the working process.
